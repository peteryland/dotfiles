# Idea from: https://github.com/Townk/tmux-config/blob/master/scripts/window-flags

# Replace tmux window flag for a unicode character:
# *: current window flag removed
# -: last window flag replaced by (⦁)
# #: window activity flag replaced by ()
# ~: window silence flag replaced by ()
# !: window bell flag replaced by ()
# Z: window zoomed flag replaced by ()

tr -d '*-' <<< "$1" | tr -s '#~!Z-' '⦁'
